# Cloud 66 ChatOps
ChatOps is an open source Slack-bot, built by [Cloud 66](http://www.cloud66.com/?utm_source=gh&utm_medium=ghp&utm_campaign=robochat). It is your very own personal-assistant that operates on your stacks directly from the Slack chat window. Now, you can display the state of your stacks, deploy them and cancel them with simple commands such as `list` , `deploy` and `cancel`.
